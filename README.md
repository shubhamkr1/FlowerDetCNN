## 🌟 Project Overview
Company ABC, a pioneer in the agritech industry, is faced with the critical need to implement an advanced automatic flower recognition system within its daily operations. ABC has started a strategic initiative to develop a prototype AI-based Computer Vision model for automatic flower recognition.

Project Benefits:
- Increased Productivity
- Improved Quality
- Technological Innovation

The main goal is to develop a highly robust model, capable of automatically classifying flowers with the best possible F1-score (macro) on the test dataset. I need to use techniques such as:
- Augmentation Strategies: implement different augmentation techniques to enrich the dataset, improving data variability and quality.
- Network Architectures and Transfer Learning: select and implement one or more neural network architectures wiht PyTorch's timm library, using transfer learning to exploit pre-trained models.
- Validation and Regularization: retraining with validation and regularization techniques to improve the model performance.
- Object detection: this part has to be done using YOLO models and supervision library from Roboflow.

## 🍽️ Dataset

The dataset provided by ProfessionAI ([link](https://proai-datasets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/progetto-finale-flowes.tar.gz) to download this dataset) includes two main categories of flowers:

- Daisy: 529 training images, 163 validation, 77 test.
- Dandelion: 746 training images, 201 validation, 105 test.

## 🛠️ Methods with PyTorch

This project leverages PyTorch to implement a robust and flexible system for training and evaluating CNN models. I've designed several custom classes to streamline the experimental process, you can find them [here](src/models.py)

### Experiment Class

The `Experiment` class serves as the backbone of the training pipeline. It manages:

- Logging of training progress
- Saving and loading of model weights
- Visualization of training history
- Exporting of results

Key features:
- Automatic creation of directory structure for each experiment
- CSV logging of training and validation metrics
- Plotting of training history
- JSON export of final results


### Model Architecture

This project leverages PyTorch along with the `timm` (PyTorch Image Models) library as the primary framework for model implementation. The choice of `timm` over traditional `torchvision` models was driven by several key advantages:

- Access to a wider range of state-of-the-art models
- Better documentation and community support
- Consistent API across different model architectures
- Regular updates with the latest architectures
- Pre-trained weights availability

For the classification task, I experimented with three carefully selected models:
1. `efficientnet_b5.sw_in12k_ft_in1k`: A top-performing model known for its efficiency-accuracy trade-off
2. `convnext_base`: A more recent architecture that shows strong performance
3. `resnet50`: A classic architecture serving as a reliable baseline

Each model was tested in two configurations:
- Direct fine-tuning with modified classification head
- Custom classifier addition with trainable layers

### Training and Evaluation Functions

The `train_model` function encapsulates the entire training loop, including:

- Epoch-wise training and validation
- Logging of metrics
- Execution of callbacks
- Resuming training from checkpoints

The `validate` and `get_predictions` functions provide easy-to-use interfaces for model evaluation and inference.


## 🖼️ Visualization and Preprocessing

I conducted a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis to understand this dataset better. The full EDA can be found in the [project notebook](project_notebook.ipynb), but here are some key insights:

- Class Distribution: The dataset shows a slight imbalance between classes:
  - Daisy: 529 training images (41.5%), 163 validation images (44.8%), 77 test images (42.3%)
  - Dandelion: 746 training images (58.5%), 201 validation images (55.2%), 105 test images (57.7%)
  While there is an imbalance, the ratio remains consistent across splits and is not severe enough to significantly impact binary classification.

- Image Dimensions: All images are consistently sized at 512x512 pixels.

- Color Distribution: Analysis of a sample of images revealed a tendency towards green tones, with less representation in the blue spectrum, as expected in a flowers dataset.

For a more detailed visual exploration of the dataset, including class distribution plots, image dimension analysis, and color histograms, please refer to the EDA section in the project notebook. Functions code is [here](src/visualization.py)

### Preprocessing and Data Augmentation

Preprocessing pipeline was implemented using the `Albumentations` library, chosen for its efficiency and wide range of image augmentation techniques. The pipeline includes:

1. Resizing: All images are resized to 224x224 pixels to standardize input for these models.
2. Normalization: Images are normalized using mean and standard deviation values of (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) for each channel.

For data augmentation, I implemented a comprehensive approach that includes:

1. Basic geometric transformations:
   - `A.RandomRotate90()`
   - `A.Flip()`
   - `A.Transpose()`

2. Image enhancement transformations (with 0.2 probability):
   - `A.Sharpen(alpha=(0.2, 0.3), lightness=(0.5, 0.7))`
   - `A.RandomBrightnessContrast(brightness_limit=0.1, contrast_limit=0.1)`

These augmentation techniques were carefully selected to preserve the natural appearance of flowers while increasing dataset variability.

You can find [here](src/preprocessing.py) the class Transforms and methods I've used for this project step.


## 🚀 Transfer Learning with timm

### Model Architecture

The project implements a sophisticated transfer learning architecture through a custom `TransferLearningModel` class. This class provides:

- Flexible Model Integration
- Dual Classifier Options:
  - Original classifier with modified output layer
  - Custom classifier with configurable dense layers and dropout
- Layer Freezing Control:
  - Selective layer freezing for fine-tuning optimization
  - Option to freeze all layers except the classifier

This architecture allows for both automated and manual fine-tuning approaches, making it easy to experiment with different transfer learning strategies while maintaining code consistency.

Key observations:
- All models achieved impressive performance with F1 scores consistently above 90%
- Some configurations (particularly EfficientNet B5) showed signs of overfitting, suggesting potential benefits from increased dropout or L2 regularization
- While ConvNext Base achieved the highest test F1 score (0.98), the discrepancy between training/validation and test performance raises concerns about stability
- ResNet50 emerged as the most reliable choice, maintaining consistent performance (~0.95 F1 score) across all splits with minimal variance
- Misclassified images are few, but when you view them with the ground truth you can understand that the models mistake images of flowers taken from below, very small flowers with a lot of background and confuse completely yellow Dandelion with Daisy.
